Car Nerd is my version of a mock car buying marketplace. I wanted to challenge myself to see if I could put together a web application in two weeks that was analagous to a marketplace online.

I used a [real dataset I found online](https://www.kaggle.com/jingbinxu/sample-of-car-data), it had a list of cars and relevant info a car buyer or auctioneer might need.

This web application uses the following technologies:

- Handlebars (for HTML Server Side templating)
- MySQL Database (JawsDB with Heroku)
- Sequelize ORM
- NodeJS and Express Web Server
